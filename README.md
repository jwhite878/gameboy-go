# gameboy-go
This project is a GameBoy emulator written in Golang. 

I started it primarily because I was interested in learning Go, and because I love the GameBoy console. 
I've also wanted to revisit emulation ever since I did an assignment on it in college. 

This repo is totally open source. Feel free to copy it, steal it, play with it, or do whatever you want.

This is very much a work in progress and a learning exercise. No guarantees it won't crash, use at your own risk, etc. etc... 

Thanks for visiting!
